# Kidney-Genetics - Designing a reproducible and curated database of kidney-related genes
Welcome to the GitHub repository  "Kidney-Genetics", a systematically curated, reproducible list of all relevant kidney-related genes known to date. This project aims to provide a unified and standardized database of kidney disease-associated genes, contributing to improved diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring of kidney diseases. The database is designed to be automatically updated on a regular basis, ensuring the incorporation of the most up-to-date genetic findings in kidney research.

## Overview and Methods

The Kidney-Genetics Atlas contains information about > 1.400 of kidney-associated genes. This information was gathered from various reliable sources, such as Genomics England PanelApp, PanelApp Australia, PubTator, OMIM, Orphanet, clinical diagnostic panels, and comprehensive literature review.

## Usage

The Kidney-Genetics Atlas is publicly available and accessible through GitHub. Furthermore, the database is automatically and regularly updated to ensure its currency and relevance.
