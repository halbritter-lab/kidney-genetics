### README for the `functions` Folder

#### Overview
The `functions` folder contains a collection of R script files that define specific functions for various bioinformatics and data processing tasks. Each script is tailored to a particular domain or functionality, as described below.

#### Files and Descriptions

1. **`gnomad-functions.R`**: Functions for interacting with gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database), providing access to aggregated genomic data.
2. **`ensembl-functions.R`**: Functions for working with Ensembl, a comprehensive database for genome information.
3. **`hgnc-functions.R`**: Functions related to HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) for gene naming and identification.
4. **`blueprintgenetics-functions.R`**: Functions for handling data related to Blueprint Genetics, a genetic testing and diagnostics company.
5. **`phantomjs-functions.R`**: Functions for interacting with PhantomJS, a headless browser used for automation and testing.
6. **`string-functions.R`**: General utility functions for string manipulation and text processing.
7. **`natera-functions.R`**: Functions related to Natera, focusing on genetic testing and personalized medical solutions.
8. **`file-functions.R`**: General-purpose functions for file reading, writing, and management.
9. **`NCBI-datasets-v2-API-functions.R`**: Functions to interface with NCBI datasets through their version 2 API, enabling access to a wide range of biological data.
10. **`hpo-functions.R`**: Functions related to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), assisting in the annotation and analysis of human phenotypic data.
11. **`PubTator-functions.R`**: Functions for working with PubTator, a tool for automated annotation of biomedical text.

#### Usage
These function files are intended to be sourced by various scripts within the project, providing reusable code for common tasks and specific bioinformatics operations.
