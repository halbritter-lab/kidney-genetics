	abstract = {Genetic kidney disease comprises a diverse group of disorders. These can roughly be divided in the phenotype groups congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, ciliopathies, glomerulopathies, stone disorders, tubulointerstitial kidney disease, and tubulopathies. Many etiologies can lead to chronic kidney disease that can progress to end-stage kidney disease. Despite each individual disease being rare, together these genetic disorders account for a large proportion of kidney disease cases. With the introduction of massively parallel sequencing, genetic testing has become more accessible, but a comprehensive analysis of the diagnostic yield is lacking. This review gives an overview of the diagnostic yield of genetic testing across and within the full range of kidney disease phenotypes through a systematic literature search that resulted in 115 included articles. Patient, test, and cohort characteristics that can influence the diagnostic yield are highlighted. Detection of copy number variations and their contribution to the diagnostic yield is described for all phenotype groups. Also, the impact of a genetic diagnosis for a patient and family members, which can be diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic, is shown through the included articles. This review will allow clinicians to estimate an a priori probability of finding a genetic cause for the kidney disease in their patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue in the USA. Identification of monogenic causes of CKD, which are present in ∼10\% of adult cases, can impact prognosis and patient management. Broad gene panels can provide unbiased testing approaches, which are advantageous in phenotypically heterogeneous diseases. However, the use and yield of broad genetic panels by nephrologists in clinical practice is not yet well characterized.
METHODS: Renal genetic testing, ordered exclusively for clinical purposes, predominantly by general and transplant nephrologists within the USA, was performed on 1,007 consecutive unique patient samples. Testing was performed using a commercially available next-generation sequencing-based 382 gene kidney disease panel. Pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic (LP) variants were reported. Positive findings included a monoallelic P/LP variant in an autosomal dominant or X-linked gene and biallelic P/LP variants in autosomal recessive genes.
RESULTS: Positive genetic findings were identified in 21.1\% (212/1,007) of cases. A total of 220 positive results were identified across 48 genes. Positive results occurred most frequently in the PKD1 (34.1\%), COL4A5 (10.9\%), PKD2 (10.0\%), COL4A4 (6.4\%), COL4A3 (5.9\%), and TTR (4.1\%) genes. Variants identified in the remaining 42 genes comprised 28.6\% of the total positive findings, including single positive results in 26 genes. Positive results in {\textgreater}1 gene were identified in 7.5\% (16/212) of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of broad panel genetic testing by clinical nephrologists had a high success rate, similar to results obtained by academic centers specializing in genetics.},

Herein, we sought to elucidate the genetic causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and identify genetic variants associated with CKD and related traits in Saudi kidney disease patients. We applied a genetic testing approach using a targeted next-generation sequencing gene panel including 102 genes causative or associated with CKD. A total of 1,098 Saudi participants were recruited for the study, including 534 patients with ESRD and 564 healthy controls. The pre-validated NGS panel was utilized to screen for genetic variants, and then, statistical analysis was conducted to test for associations. The NGS panel revealed 7,225 variants in 102 sequenced genes. Cases had a significantly higher number of confirmed pathogenic variants as classified by the ClinVar database than controls (i.e., individuals with at least one allele of a confirmed pathogenic variant that is associated with CKD; 279 (0.52) vs. 258 (0.45); p-value = 0.03). A total of 13 genetic variants were found to be significantly associated with ESRD in PLCE1, CLCN5, ATP6V1B1, LAMB2, INVS, FRAS1, C5orf42, SLC12A3, COL4A6, SLC3A1, RET, WNK1, and BICC1, including four novel variants that were not previously reported in any other population.

Genetic findings are increasingly used to inform clinical management of nephropathies, and have led to improved diagnostics, disease surveillance, choice of therapy, and family counseling. All of these steps rely on accurate interpretation of genetic data, which can be outpaced by current rates of data collection. In March of 2021, Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference on "Genetics in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)" to review the current state of understanding of monogenic and complex (polygenic) kidney diseases, processes for applying genetic findings in clinical medicine, and use of genomics for defining and stratifying CKD. Given the important contribution of genetic variants to CKD, practitioners with CKD patients are advised to "think genetic," which specifically involves obtaining a family history, collecting detailed information on age of CKD onset, performing clinical examination for extrarenal symptoms, and considering genetic testing. To improve the use of genetics in nephrology, meeting participants advised developing an advanced training or subspecialty track for nephrologists, crafting guidelines for testing and treatment, and educating patients, students, and practitioners. Key areas of future research, including clinical interpretation of genome variation, electronic phenotyping, global representation, kidney-specific molecular data, polygenic scores, translational epidemiology, and open data resources, were also identified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing is increasingly being used for clinical diagnostics, with an impetus to expand reporting of incidental findings across a wide range of disorders. Analysis of population cohorts can help reduce risk for genetic variant misclassification and resultant unnecessary referrals to subspecialists.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the burden of candidate pathogenic variants for kidney and genitourinary disorders emerging from exome sequencing.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of genetic data.
SETTING: A tertiary care academic medical center.
PATIENTS: A convenience sample of exome sequence data from 7974 self-declared healthy adults.
MEASUREMENTS: Assessment of the prevalence of candidate pathogenic variants in 625 genes associated with Mendelian kidney and genitourinary disorders.
RESULTS: Of all participants, 23.3\% carried a candidate pathogenic variant, most of which were attributable to previously reported variants that had implausibly high allele frequencies. In particular, 25 genes (discovered before the creation of the Exome Aggregation Consortium, a genetic database comprising data from a large control population) accounted for 67.7\% of persons with candidate pathogenic variants. After stringent filtering based on allele frequency, 1.4\% of persons still had a candidate pathogenic variant, an excessive rate given the prevalence of monogenic kidney and genitourinary disorders. Manual annotation of a subset of variants showed that the majority would be classified as nonbenign under current guidelines for clinical sequence interpretation and could prompt subspecialty referrals if returned.
LIMITATION: Limited access to health record data prevented comprehensive assessment of the phenotypic concordance with genetic diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: Widespread reporting of incidental genetic findings related to kidney and genitourinary disorders will require stringent curation of clinical variant databases and detailed case-level review to avoid genetic misdiagnosis and unnecessary referrals. These findings motivate similar analyses for genes relevant to other medical subspecialties.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we undertook genetic testing in adults with suspected GKD according to prespecified criteria. Over 7 years, patients were referred from tertiary centres across Ireland to an academic medical centre as part of the Irish Kidney Gene Project.
RESULTS: Among 677 patients, the mean age was of 37.2 ± 13 years, and 73.9\% of the patients had family history of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We achieved a molecular diagnostic rate of 50.9\%. Four genes accounted for more than 70\% of identified pathogenic variants: PKD1 and PKD2 (n = 186, 53.4\%), MUC1 (8.9\%), and COL4A5 (8.3\%). In 162 patients with a genetic diagnosis, excluding PKD1/PKD2, the a priori diagnosis was confirmed in 58\% and in 13\% the diagnosis was reclassified. A genetic diagnosis was established in 22 (29.7\%) patients with CKD of uncertain aetiology. Based on genetic testing, a diagnostic kidney biopsy was unnecessary in 13 (8\%) patients. Presence of family history of CKD and the underlying a priori diagnosis were independent predictors (P {\textless} 0.001) of a positive genetic diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated GKD clinic is a valuable resource, and its implementation of various genomic strategies has resulted in a direct, demonstrable clinical and therapeutic benefits to affected patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a rare genetic cause of renal impairment resulting from mutations in the MUC1, UMOD, HNF1B, REN, and SEC61A1 genes. Neither the national or global prevalence of these diseases has been determined. We aimed to establish a database of patients with ADTKD in Ireland and report the clinical and genetic characteristics of these families. Methods: We identified patients via the Irish Kidney Gene Project and referral to the national renal genetics clinic in Beaumont Hospital who met the clinical criteria for ADTKD (chronic kidney disease, bland urinary sediment, and autosomal dominant inheritance). Eligible patients were then invited to undergo genetic testing by a variety of methods including panel-based testing, whole exome sequencing and, in five families who met the criteria for diagnosis of ADTKD but were negative for causal genetic mutations, we analyzed urinary cell smears for the presence of MUC1fs protein. Results: We studied 54 individuals from 16 families. We identified mutations in the MUC1 gene in three families, UMOD in five families, HNF1beta in two families, and the presence of abnormal MUC1 protein in urine smears in three families (one of which was previously known to carry the genetic mutation). We were unable to identify a mutation in 4 families (3 of whom also tested negative for urinary MUC1fs). Conclusions: There are 4443 people with ESRD in Ireland, 24 of whom are members of the cohort described herein. We observe that ADTKD represents at least 0.54\% of Irish ESRD patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Renal biopsy is the mainstay of renal pathological diagnosis. Despite sophisticated diagnostic techniques, it is not always possible to make a precise pathological diagnosis. Our aim was to identify a genetic cause of disease in patients who had undergone renal biopsy and determine if genetic testing altered diagnosis or treatment.
METHODS: Patients with suspected familial kidney disease underwent a variety of next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies. The subset of these patients who had also undergone native kidney biopsy was identified. Histological specimens were reviewed by a consultant pathologist, and genetic and pathological diagnoses were compared.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients in 47 families underwent genetic sequencing and renal biopsy. Patients were grouped into 5 diagnostic categories based on pathological diagnosis: tubulointerstitial kidney disease (TIKD; n = 18); glomerulonephritis (GN; n = 15); focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and Alport Syndrome (n = 11); thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA; n = 17); and nonspecific pathological changes (n = 14). Thirty-nine patients (52\%) in 21 families (45\%) received a genetic diagnosis; 13 cases (72\%) with TIKD, 4 (27\%) with GN, 6 (55\%) with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis/Alport syndrome, and 10 (59\%) with TMA and 6 cases (43\%) with nonspecific features. Genetic testing resulted in changes in understanding of disease mechanism in 21 individuals (54\%) in 12 families (57\%). Treatment would have been altered in at least 26\% of cases (10/39).
CONCLUSIONS: An accurate genetic diagnosis can result in changes in clinical diagnosis, understanding of pathological mechanism, and treatment. NGS should be considered as a complementary diagnostic technique to kidney biopsy in the evaluation of patients with kidney disease.},

	abstract = {Molecular diagnosis of inherited kidney diseases remains a challenge due to their expanding phenotypic spectra as well as the constantly growing list of disease-causing genes. Here we develop a comprehensive approach for genetic diagnosis of inherited cystic and glomerular nephropathies. Targeted next generation sequencing of 140 genes causative of or associated with cystic or glomerular nephropathies was performed in 421 patients, a validation cohort of 116 patients with previously known mutations, and a diagnostic cohort of 207 patients with suspected inherited cystic disease and 98 patients with glomerular disease. In the validation cohort, a sensitivity of 99\% was achieved. In the diagnostic cohort, causative mutations were found in 78\% of patients with cystic disease and 62\% of patients with glomerular disease, mostly familial cases, including copy number variants. Results depict the distribution of different cystic and glomerular inherited diseases showing the most likely diagnosis according to perinatal, pediatric and adult disease onset. Of all the genetically diagnosed patients, 15\% were referred with an unspecified clinical diagnosis and in 2\% genetic testing changed the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, in 17\% of cases our genetic analysis was crucial to establish the correct diagnosis. Complex inheritance patterns in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and Alport syndrome were suspected in seven and six patients, respectively. Thus, our kidney-disease gene panel is a comprehensive, noninvasive, and cost-effective tool for genetic diagnosis of cystic and glomerular inherited kidney diseases. This allows etiologic diagnosis in three-quarters of patients and is especially valuable in patients with unspecific or atypical phenotypes.},

	abstract = {End-stage renal disease (ESRD) of undetermined etiology is highly prevalent and constitutes a significant clinical challenge, particularly in the context of kidney transplantation (KT). Despite the identification of numerous rare hereditary nephropathies over the last few decades, patients with undetermined ESRD are not being systematically investigated for rare genetic causes in clinical practice. To address this, we utilized mutation analysis in patients on the kidney transplant waitlist and scrutinized underlying renal diagnoses of 142 patients in a single center KT-waitlist. This cohort was stratified into 85 cases of determined and 57 cases of undetermined ESRD. The latter patients were analyzed by a renal gene panel for mutations in 209 genes associated with ESRD. The most likely genetic diagnoses in 12\% of the tested individuals with undetermined ESRD were established. All of these patients showed mutations in genes encoding components of the glomerular filtration barrier. Taken together, hereditary nephropathies, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, were identified in 35 of the 142 patients of the waitlist cohort. By significantly increasing the proportion of hereditary diagnoses from 29 to 35 patients, the rate of undetermined ESRD significantly decreased from 57 to 51 patients. This study demonstrates the beneficial use of genetic diagnostics in significantly unraveling undetermined ESRD cases prior to KT. Thus, in the absence of renal histology or the presence of unspecific histological conditions, such as hypertensive nephrosclerosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or thrombotic microangiopathy, genetic analysis may provide a robust and specific renal diagnosis and allow for optimizing pre- and post-KT management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inherited cystic kidney disorders are a common cause of end-stage renal disease. Over 50 ciliopathy genes, which encode proteins that influence the structure and function of the primary cilia, are implicated in cystic kidney disease.
METHODS: To define the phenotype and genotype of cystic kidney disease in fetuses and neonates, we correlated antenatal ultrasound examination and postnatal renal ultrasound examination with targeted exon sequencing, using a renal gene panel. A cohort of 44 families in whom antenatal renal ultrasound scanning findings in affected cases included bilateral cystic kidney disease, echogenic kidneys or enlarged kidneys was investigated.
RESULTS: In this cohort, disease phenotypes were severe with 36 cases of stillbirth or perinatal death. Extra renal malformations, including encephalocele, polydactyly and heart malformations, consistent with ciliopathy phenotypes, were frequently detected. Renal gene panel testing identified causative mutations in 21 out of 34 families (62\%), where patient and parental DNA was available. In the remaining 10 families, where only parental DNA was available, 7 inferred causative mutations were found. Together, mutations were found in 12 different genes with a total of 13 novel pathogenic variants, including an inferred novel variant in NEK8. Mutations in CC2D2A were the most common cause of an antenatal cystic kidney disease and a suspected ciliopathy in our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: In families with ciliopathy phenotypes, mutational analysis using a targeted renal gene panel allows a rapid molecular diagnosis and provides important information for patients, parents and their physicians.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inherited kidney diseases are one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that manifests before the age of 30 years. Precise clinical diagnosis of early-onset CKD is complicated due to the high phenotypic overlap, but genetic testing is a powerful diagnostic tool. We aimed to develop a genetic testing strategy to maximize the diagnostic yield for patients presenting with early-onset CKD and to determine the prevalence of the main causative genes.
METHODS: We performed genetic testing of 460 patients with early-onset CKD of suspected monogenic cause using next-generation sequencing of a custom-designed kidney disease gene panel in addition to targeted screening for c.428dupC MUC1.
RESULTS: We achieved a global diagnostic yield of 65\% (300/460), which varied depending on the clinical diagnostic group: 77\% in cystic kidney diseases, 76\% in tubulopathies, 67\% in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, 61\% in glomerulopathies and 38\% in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Among the 300 genetically diagnosed patients, the clinical diagnosis was confirmed in 77\%, a specific diagnosis within a clinical diagnostic group was identified in 15\%, and 7\% of cases were reclassified. Of the 64 causative genes identified in our cohort, 7 (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, HNF1B, PKD1, PKD2 and PKHD1) accounted for 66\% (198/300) of the genetically diagnosed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of patients with early-onset CKD in this cohort had a genetic cause. Just seven genes were responsible for the majority of diagnoses. Establishing a genetic diagnosis is crucial to define the precise aetiology of CKD, which allows accurate genetic counselling and improved patient management.},

	abstract = {We report the screening of a large panel of genes in a series of 100 fetuses (98 families) affected with severe renal defects. Causative variants were identified in 22\% of cases, greatly improving genetic counseling. The percentage of variants explaining the phenotype was different according to the type of phenotype. The highest diagnostic yield was found in cases affected with the ciliopathy-like phenotype (11/15 families and, in addition, a single heterozygous or a homozygous Class 3 variant in PKHD1 in three unrelated cases with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease). The lowest diagnostic yield was observed in cases with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (9/78 families and, in addition, Class 3 variants in GREB1L in three unrelated cases with bilateral renal agenesis). Inheritance was autosomal recessive in nine genes (PKHD1, NPHP3, CEP290, TMEM67, DNAJB11, FRAS1, ACE, AGT, and AGTR1), and autosomal dominant in six genes (PKD1, PKD2, PAX2, EYA1, BICC1, and MYOCD). Finally, we developed an original approach of next-generation sequencing targeted RNA sequencing using the custom capture panel used for the sequencing of DNA, to validate one MYOCD heterozygous splicing variant identified in two male siblings with megabladder and inherited from their healthy mother.},
