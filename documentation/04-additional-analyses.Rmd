## Diagnostic panels content overlap

> Below you can see a bar plot of the diagnostic panels content overlap.

We used ten common diagnostic panels that can be ordered for kidney disease analysis and extracted the screened genes from them.
Here we show the overlap of the genes in the different panels.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# Summarize the data
count_data <- DiagnosticPanels_genes %>%
  group_by(source_count) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

# Calculate the total number of genes
total_genes <- sum(count_data$n)

# Calculate the percentage of genes
count_data <- count_data %>%
  mutate(percentage = (n / total_genes) * 100)

# Create a new column for fill color based on source_count values
count_data <- count_data %>%
  mutate(fill_color = case_when(
    source_count == 1 ~ "Red",
    source_count == 10 ~ "Green",
    TRUE ~ "Gray"
  ))

# Create the plot
diagnostic_panels_overlap_plot <- ggplot(count_data, aes(x = source_count, y = n, fill = fill_color)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), vjust = -0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(count_data$source_count), max(count_data$source_count), by = 1)) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  labs(x = "Count of panels", y = "Number of Genes",
       title = paste0("Number of genes in 10 clinical diagnostic panels for kidney disease (n = ", total_genes, ")")) +
  theme_minimal()
