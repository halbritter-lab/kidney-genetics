Objective How can we address the lack of a unified and standardized database of kidney disease-associated genes, which hampers diagnosis, treatment, and research comparability in the field of kidney diseases? Methods To create a comprehensive and standardized database of kidney-related genes, we employed the following methods: Utilized data from Genomics England and Australia PanelApp. Conducted a comprehensive literature review of published gene lists. Collected information from clinical diagnostic panels for kidney disease. Performed a Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)-based search in rare disease databases (OMIM, Orphanet). Employed a PubTator API-based automated literature extraction from PubMed. We also developed an evidence-scoring system to differentiate highly confirmed disease genes from candidate genes. In order to make our approach more transparent and thus more comprehensible, we have attached our current workflow as a chart. (#fig:curation_flow_diagram)Curation process flow diagram 0.1 Results The “Kidney-Genetics” database currently includes detailed information on 2,906 kidney-associated genes. Notably, 439 genes (15.1%) are present in three or more of the analyzed information sources, indicating high confidence and their potential for diagnostic use. To ensure currency, Kidney-Genetics will be regularly and automatically updated. We will also provide phenotypic and functional clustering results to facilitate gene grouping. 0.2 Conclusion Kidney-Genetics is a comprehensive and freely accessible database that researchers can use to analyze genomic data related to kidney diseases. The database is regularly updated through a standardized pipeline and an automated system, ensuring it remains up-to-date with the latest advancements in kidney research and diagnostics. By utilizing Kidney-Genetics, clinicians and researchers can enhance their understanding of the genetic aspects of kidney disorders. 0.3 Outlook Future goals include manual curation and the assignment of diagnostic genes to specific nephrology disease groups, such as syndromic vs. isolated, adult- vs. pediatric-onset, and cystic vs. nephrotic, among others.
